The plan outlines a FastAPI application with the following components:

1. **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies such as fastapi, uvicorn, and python-crontab.
2. **app.py**: Main FastAPI application file. It includes:
   - FastAPI instance
   - CronJob Pydantic model
   - Endpoints for creating, deleting, and listing cron jobs
   - Critical methods: create_cron(job: CronJob) -> dict, delete_cron(command: str) -> dict, list_crons() -> list
3. **cli.py**: Typer CLI wrapper providing command-line access to the FastAPI app's functionality. It includes:
   - Commands to start the server, create a cron job, delete a cron job, and list all cron jobs
   - Critical methods: start_server() -> None, create_cron(command: str, schedule: str) -> None, delete_cron(command: str) -> None, list_crons() -> None

This architecture is viable for managing cron jobs via a FastAPI application with both web and CLI interfaces.
